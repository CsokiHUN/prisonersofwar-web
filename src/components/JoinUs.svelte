        Yes, we know it is still early daysâ€¦ but the early bird gets the worm, right? If you want to be one of the pioneers here, please
        state your interest. Judging by comments from the Blizzard team, it is very likely that guilds are not region restricted, so we are
        accepting guildies from anywhere in the world.
